  
  ## I really like the idea of Proj Source 
## I don't know if i need a PlayerId for each player because espn has full names now 

  # i gotta think about pages
  * Build pages:

    * **Standings** (team totals by week).
    * **Roster Boxscores** (team‚Äôs week performance).
    * **Player Page** (individual game logs).
    * **Free Agents** (sorted by recent fantasy points).

## üìç Where You Are Now

* **Data Source:** ‚úÖ ESPN scraping pipeline working.
* **Projections:**

  * ‚úÖ Returning WCC players = solid projections.
  * ‚úÖ Incoming transfers = adjusted projections based on prior conference stats.
  * ‚è≥ Freshmen / ‚Äúno-stats‚Äù players = need coverage.
* **Draft Materials:**

  * ‚úÖ Draft board framework built.
  * ‚è≥ Need roster_match to find ‚Äúprojection gaps‚Äù (freshmen, redshirts, etc.).
* **Tech Setup:**

  * Have CSV outputs (players, game logs).
  * Haven‚Äôt yet built SQLite + Streamlit workflow.

---

## üîú Next Steps (Draft First, Then Platform)

### 1. **Finish Draft Materials**

* **Roster Match:**

  * Compare ESPN rosters vs. your projection list.
  * Output ‚Üí list of players without projections (freshmen, internationals, untracked transfers).
* **Handle Missing Projections:**

  * Assign baseline projections (e.g., bottom-tier ADP, randomized floor).
  * Mark them clearly (e.g., `ProjSource = "Baseline"`) so they‚Äôre distinguishable later.


* **Lock Draft Board:**

  * Every WCC player has: `PlayerID, Name, Team, Projection, ADP`.
  * You can now run a **draft simulation** and output `FantasyRosters_Week1.csv`.

---

### 2. **Lock In Weekly Workflow**

Once draft materials are locked:

* **Roster Snapshots:**

  * Week 1 ‚Üí `FantasyRosters.csv`.
  * Copy forward weekly and apply transactions (add/drop/trade).
* **Game Logs:**

  * Keep scraping game stats ‚Üí append to `GameLog.csv`.
  * Always include `PlayerID` for clean joins.
* **Merge:**

  * Join `FantasyRosters` + `GameLog` on `(PlayerID, Week)`.
  * Unified dataset = ‚Äútruth‚Äù for standings, box scores, free agents.

---

### 3. **SQLite + Streamlit Platform**

* **SQLite Setup:**

  * Import `FantasyRosters.csv` and `GameLog.csv`.
  * Test key queries:

    * Points per FantasyTeam per Week.
    * Player logs per FantasyTeam.
    * Free agents with last week‚Äôs stats.
* **Streamlit Setup:**

  * Build pages:

    * **Standings** (team totals by week).
    * **Roster Boxscores** (team‚Äôs week performance).
    * **Player Page** (individual game logs).
    * **Free Agents** (sorted by recent fantasy points).

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* **Draft Phase:** Almost complete ‚Üí just need to patch projection gaps and finalize draft board.
* **Workflow Phase:** Next priority ‚Üí set in stone how snapshots + game logs merge.
* **Platform Phase:** After that, load everything into SQLite + build Streamlit dashboards.

This way, your draft materials don‚Äôt block your season workflow, and your workflow is already designed to scale once you bring Streamlit online.

Do you want me to sketch out the **roster_match logic** (e.g., how to programmatically find missing projections and tag them), or the **Streamlit page layout structure** next?
